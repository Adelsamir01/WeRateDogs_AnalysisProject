## Gathering, Assessing, Cleaning, and Visualizing the Data

#### Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

## Tasks Done in this project are as follows:

### Data wrangling, which consists of:
#### Gathering data
#### Assessing data
#### Cleaning data

### Storing, analyzing, and visualizing  wrangled data
### Reporting on 1) data wrangling efforts and 2) data analyses and visualizations
